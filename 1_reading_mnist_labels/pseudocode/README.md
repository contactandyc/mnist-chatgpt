# ChatGTP Response

Sure! Below is the code written in pseudocode to read files with the specified format and print their contents:

```plaintext
Structure FileResponse:
    int magic_number
    int num_items
    Array of unsigned char labels

Function read_file(file_name):
    Declare response as FileResponse
    Open file with name file_name in binary read mode
    If file does not exist:
        Print "Error opening file."
        Exit with error code 1
    End If

    Read magic_number from file and store in response.magic_number
    Convert magic_number to big-endian if necessary

    Read num_items from file and store in response.num_items
    Convert num_items to big-endian if necessary

    Allocate memory for the labels array with size response.num_items
    If memory allocation fails:
        Print "Memory allocation error."
        Close the file
        Exit with error code 1
    End If

    Read the labels array from the file and store it in response.labels

    Close the file
    Return response

Function free_file_response(response):
    Free memory allocated for response.labels

Function process_file(file_name):
    response = read_file(file_name)

    Print "File:", file_name
    Print "Magic Number:", response.magic_number
    Print "Number of Items:", response.num_items

    Print "Labels:"
    For i from 0 to response.num_items - 1:
        Print "[", i, "]", response.labels[i]

    Free the memory allocated for response.labels

Function main(argc, argv):
    If argc < 2:
        Print "Usage:", argv[0], "file1 file2 file3 ..."
        Return with error code 1
    End If

    For i from 1 to argc - 1:
        Call process_file with argv[i]

    Return with success code 0
```

Please note that this pseudocode is intended to represent the structure and logic of the code. It does not contain specific syntax or details of the C programming language. When implementing this in C, you will need to use the actual C syntax and library functions to achieve the functionality described in the pseudocode.
